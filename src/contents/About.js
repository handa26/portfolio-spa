        <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          A self-taught coder who has cracked the tech industry through a
          sterling online, started my journey from an young age, now I'm 17
          years old, decided to pursue my dream as a web developer. Web
          development is my center of interest as well as others field, I love
          the idea of cross-platform development, 1 on 1 code base deploy into
          almost any cross-platform, which web technology, especially,
          Javascript enables me to do so. I also care about creating Interactive
          UI components for better UX and share those to the world through
          Github.
